Project Overview

This project is a RESTful API built using Flask and SQLite, designed to perform basic CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on items. Each item consists of a name and a description. The API allows users to create new items, view all items or a single item by ID, update existing items, and delete items from the database.

The project demonstrates fundamental backend development skills with Python, including working with Flask, handling HTTP requests, and interacting with a database using SQLAlchemy. It provides a simple yet complete example of building a REST API that can serve as a foundation for more advanced web applications or integration with front-end interfaces.
